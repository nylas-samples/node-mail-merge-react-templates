Explore working front-end and back-end sample code in our sample Nylas integrations.

The sample applications redirect to Nylas' hosted authentication page. Once a user authenticates, it allows them to interact with Nylas' APIs from a web client.

## ⚡️ App Set up

View the `README.md` files in the `backend` and `frontend` directories for instructions on how to set up the server and client. These README files include set up instructions for each language.

Start the backend server first, then in a new terminal, start the frontend server.

Once the servers are running, visit the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can also visit the backend server at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).
